                    accordance with § 7 paragraph 1 TMG under the general laws. According to §§ 8
                    to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated as a service provider to monitor
                    transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances
                    that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of
                    information under the general laws remain unaffected.</span></strong></p>
                <p ><strong><span>However, liability in this regard is
                    only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the
                    law becomes known. If we become aware of the above-mentioned infringements, we
                    will remove this content immediately.</span></strong></p>

                    websites of third parties. We have no influence on the content of these

                    correctness of the contents of the &quot;external links&quot;. The respective

                    possible legal violations at the time of linking and were free of illegal

                    external links is not possible without concrete evidence of a violation of the
                    law. In the case of direct or indirect links to the websites of third parties
                    that lie outside our area of responsibility, a liability obligation would only
                    exist in the case where we become aware of the content and it would be
                    technically possible and reasonable for us to prevent use in the case of
                    illegal content.</span></strong></p>
