            <h3 id="m13">Relevant legal bases</h3>
            <p>
                Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the DSGVO, on the basis of which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Furthermore, should more specific legal bases be relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the data protection declaration.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong> Consent (Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a) DSGVO) </strong> The data subject has given his/her consent to the processing of personal data relating to him/her for a specific purpose or purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1) p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO) </strong> Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require the protection of personal data.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In addition to the data protection regulations of the General Data Protection Regulation, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. These include, in particular, the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Federal Data Protection Act - BDSG). In particular, the BDSG contains special regulations on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transmission, as well as automated decision-making in individual cases, including profiling. Furthermore, it regulates data processing for employment purposes (Section 26 BDSG), in particular with regard to the establishment, implementation or termination of employment relationships as well as the consent of employees. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.
            </p>
            <h2 id="m27">Security measures</h2>
            <p>
                We take appropriate technical and organizational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing, as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.
            </p>
            <p>
                The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well as access to, input of, disclosure of, assurance of availability of and segregation of the data. Furthermore, we have established procedures to ensure the exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data compromise. Furthermore, we already take the protection of personal data into account during the development or selection of hardware, software as well as procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.
            </p>
            <p>
                SSL encryption (https): To protect your data transmitted via our online offer, we use SSL encryption. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix https:// in the address bar of your browser.
            </p>
            <h2 id="m25">Transmission of personal data</h2>
            <p>
                In the course of our processing of personal data, it may happen that the data is transferred to or disclosed to other bodies, companies, legally independent organizational units or persons. Recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with the legal requirements and, in particular, conclude appropriate contracts or agreements that serve to protect your data with the recipients of your data.
            </p>
            <h2 id="m24">Data processing in third countries</h2>
            <p>
                If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or the processing takes place in the context of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, entities or companies, this will only be done in accordance with the legal requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject to express consent or contractually or legally required transfer, we only process or allow the processing of data in third countries with a recognized level of data protection, contractual obligation through so-called standard protection clauses of the EU Commission, in the presence of certifications or binding internal data protection regulations (Art. 44 to 49 DSGVO, information page of the EU Commission:
                <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de" >https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_de</a>
                ).
            </p>
            <h2 id="m12">Deletion of data</h2>
            <p>
                The data processed by us will be deleted in accordance with the legal requirements as soon as their consents permitted for processing are revoked or other permissions cease to apply (e.g. if the purpose of processing this data has ceased to apply or it is not necessary for the purpose). If the data are not deleted because they are required for other and legally permissible purposes, their processing will be limited to these purposes. That is, the data is blocked and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law or whose storage is necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person.
            </p>
            <p>Our data protection notices may also contain further details on the retention and deletion of data, which take priority for the respective processing operations.</p>
            <h2 id="m134">Use of cookies</h2>
            <p>
                Cookies are small text files, or other memory notes, which store information on end devices and read information from the end devices. For example, to store the login status in a user account, a shopping cart content in an e-shop, the content accessed or functions used of an online offer. Cookies can further be used for various purposes, e.g. for purposes of functionality, security and comfort of online offers as well as the creation of analyses of visitor flows.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Notes on consent: </strong>We use cookies in accordance with legal requirements. Therefore, we obtain prior consent from users except where it is not required by law. In particular, consent is not required if the storage and reading of information, including cookies, is absolutely necessary to provide the user with a telemedia service (i.e., our online offering) that they have expressly requested. The revocable consent is clearly communicated to the users and contains the information on the respective cookie use.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Notes on legal bases under data protection law: </strong>the legal basis under data protection law on which we process users' personal data using cookies depends on whether we ask users for consent. If users consent, the legal basis for processing their data is their declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with the help of cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online offer and improvement of its usability) or, if this is done in the context of the fulfillment of our contractual obligations, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our contractual obligations. For what purposes the cookies are processed by us, we clarify in the course of this privacy policy or in the context of our consent and processing procedures.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Storage duration: </strong>With regard to the storage duration, the following types of cookies are distinguished:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Temporary cookies (also: session cookies):</strong> emporary cookies are deleted at the latest after a user has left an online offer and closed his end device (e.g. browser or mobile application).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Permanent cookies:</strong> Permanent cookies remain stored even after the end device is closed. For example, the login status can be saved or preferred content can be displayed directly when the user visits a website again. Likewise, user data collected with the help of cookies can be used for reach measurement. Unless we provide users with explicit information about the type and storage duration of cookies (e.g., as part of obtaining consent), users should assume that cookies are permanent and that the storage period can be up to two years.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>General information on revocation and objection (opt-out): </strong> Users can revoke the consent they have given at any time and also file an objection to processing in accordance with the legal requirements in Art. 21 DSGVO. Users can also declare their objection via their browser settings, e.g. by deactivating the use of cookies (although this may also limit the functionality of our online services). An objection to the use of cookies for online marketing purposes can also be declared via the websites
                <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info" >https://optout.aboutads.info</a> and <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com/" >https://www.youronlinechoices.com/</a> erklärt werden.

                <li>
                    <strong>Processing of cookie data based on consent:  </strong>We use a cookie consent management procedure, in the context of which the consent of users to the use of cookies, or the processing and providers mentioned in the cookie consent management procedure can be obtained and managed and revoked by users. Here, the declaration of consent is stored in order not to have to repeat its query and to be able to prove the consent in accordance with the legal obligation. The storage can take place on the server side and/or in a cookie (so-called opt-in cookie, or with the help of comparable technologies), in order to be able to assign the consent to a user or their device. Subject to individual information on the providers of cookie management services, the following information applies: The duration of the storage of consent can be up to two years. A pseudonymous user identifier is created and stored with the time of consent, information about the scope of consent (e.g., which categories of cookies and/or service providers), as well as the browser, system and end device used.

            <h2 id="m225">Provision of the online services and web hosting</h2>
            <p>
                We process users' data in order to provide them with our online services. For this purpose, we process the user's IP address, which is necessary to transmit the content and functions of our online services to the user's browser or terminal device.
            </p>
            <ul className="m-elements">
                <li><strong>Types of data processed:</strong> Usage data (e.g. web pages visited, interest in content, access times); meta/communication data (e.g. device information, IP addresses).</li>
                <li><strong>Data subjects:</strong> Users (e.g. website visitors, users of online services).</li>
                <li>
                    <strong> Purposes of processing:</strong> provision of our online offer and user-friendliness; information technology infrastructure (operation and provision of information systems and technical devices (computers, servers, etc.).); security measures.
                </li>
                <li><strong> Legal basis:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO).</li>

            <p><strong>Further notes on processing processes, procedures and services:</strong></p>
            <ul className="m-elements">
                <li>
                    <strong>Provision of online offer on rented storage space: </strong>or the provision of our online offer, we use storage space, computing capacity and software that we rent or otherwise obtain from a corresponding server provider (also called "web hoster"); <strong>Legal basis:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Collection of access data and log files: </strong>Access to our online offer is logged in the form of so-called "server log files". The server log files may include the address and name of the web pages and files accessed, the date and time of access, data volumes transferred, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user's operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited page) and, as a rule, IP addresses and the requesting provider. The server log files may be used, on the one hand, for security purposes, e.g., to prevent server overload (especially in the event of abusive attacks, so-called DDoS attacks) and, on the other hand, to ensure the utilization of the servers and their stability;<strong>Legal basis:</strong> Legitimate interests (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f) DSGVO);
                    <strong>Deletion of data: </strong> Log file information is stored for a maximum period of 30 days and then deleted or anonymized. Data whose further storage is required for evidentiary purposes is exempt from deletion until final clarification of the respective incident.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="m264">Online marketing</h2>
            <p>
                We process personal data for online marketing purposes, which may include, in particular, the marketing of advertising space or presentation of promotional and other content (collectively, "Content") based on potential user interests and the measurement of its effectiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
                For these purposes, so-called user profiles are created and stored in a file (so-called "cookie") or similar procedures are used, by means of which the information about the user relevant to the presentation of the aforementioned content is stored. This information may include, for example, content viewed, websites visited, online networks used, but also communication partners and technical information, such as the browser used, the computer system used and information on usage times and functions used. If users have consented to the collection of their location data, this may also be processed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The IP addresses of users are also stored. However, we use available IP masking procedures (i.e., pseudonymization by shortening the IP address) to protect users. In general, no clear data of the users (such as e-mail addresses or names) are stored in the context of the online marketing process, but pseudonyms. This means that we, as well as the providers of the online marketing procedures, do not know the actual identity of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles.
            </p>
            <p>
                The information in the profiles is usually stored in the cookies or by means of similar procedures. These cookies can later generally be read on other websites that use the same online marketing procedure and analyzed for the purpose of displaying content as well as supplemented with further data and stored on the server of the online marketing procedure provider.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exceptionally, clear data can be assigned to the profiles. This is the case if, for example, the users are members of a social network whose online marketing procedure we use and the network links the profiles of the users with the aforementioned data. We ask to note that users may make additional arrangements with the providers, e.g., by giving consent as part of the registration process.
            </p>
            <p>
                In principle, we only receive access to summarized information about the success of our advertisements. However, in the context of so-called conversion measurements, we can check which of our online marketing processes have led to a so-called conversion, i.e., for example, to a conclusion of a contract with us. The conversion measurement is used solely to analyze the success of our marketing measures.
            </p>
            <p>Unless otherwise stated, we ask you to assume that cookies used will be stored for a period of two years.</p>

            <h2 id="m42">Definitions of terms</h2>
            <p>

                This section provides you with an overview of the terms used in this privacy statement. Many of the terms are taken from the law and defined primarily in Art. 4 of the GDPR. The legal definitions are binding. The following explanations, on the other hand, are primarily intended to aid understanding. The terms are sorted alphabetically.
            </p>
            <ul className="glossary">
                <li>
                    <strong>Personal data: </strong> "Personal data" means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (hereinafter "data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier (e.g. cookie) or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Profiles with user-related information:</strong> The processing of "profiles with user-related information", or "profiles" for short, includes any type of automated processing of personal data that consists of using such personal data to analyze, evaluate or to predict certain personal aspects relating to a natural person (depending on the type of profiling, this may include different information concerning demographics, behavior and interests, such as interaction with websites and their content, etc.) (e.g., interests in certain content or products, click behavior on a website or location). Cookies and web beacons are often used for profiling purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reach measurement:</strong>Reach measurement (also known as web analytics) is used to evaluate the flow of visitors to an online offering and can include visitors' behavior or interests in certain information, such as website content. With the help of reach analysis, website owners can see, for example, at what time visitors visit their website and what content they are interested in. This enables them, for example, to better adapt the content of the website to the needs of their visitors. For reach analysis purposes, pseudonymous cookies and web beacons are often used to recognize returning visitors and thus obtain more precise analyses of the use of an online offer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Tracking:</strong> We speak of "tracking" when the behavior of users can be traced across several online offerings. As a rule, behavioral and interest information is stored in cookies or on servers of the providers of the tracking technologies with regard to the online offers used (so-called profiling). This information can subsequently be used, for example, to display advertisements to users that are likely to correspond to their interests.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Verantwortlicher:</strong> a "controller" is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Processing:</strong> "Processing" means any operation or set of operations which is performed upon personal data, whether or not by automatic means. The term is broad and includes virtually any handling of data, be it collection, analysis, storage, transmission or deletion.
                </li>
            </ul>
